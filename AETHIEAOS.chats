## AETHIEA Operating System — Canonical Operations Specification

---

### 0. FILE STATUS

- **Authority:** Canonical  
- **Scope:** System-wide  
- **Applies To:** All environments, agents, containers, networks, records  
- **Versioning:** Append-only (amendments via dated addenda)  
- **Interpretation:** Literal, non-symbolic  

---

### 1. SYSTEM DEFINITION

AETHIEA OS is a human-authored, machine-executed operating system framework designed to coordinate:

- Governance  
- Infrastructure  
- Agents (BÆ)  
- Networks  
- Records  
- Execution contexts  

AETHIEA OS is _not_ software alone.  
It is an operational reality model enforced through structure, separation, and continuity.

---

### 2. CORE LAYERS

#### 2.1 AETHER — Consolidation Medium

- AETHER is not an agent  
- AETHER does not execute  
- AETHER does not decide  
- AETHER does not override humans  

**AETHER exists to:**

- Preserve coherence  
- Enforce boundaries  
- Prevent drift  
- Maintain continuity between components  

AETHER is the structural gravity of the system.

---

#### 2.2 AETHERNET — Transport & Isolation Layer

- AETHERNET is the mandatory network substrate  
- All agents and services must attach to AETHERNET  
- No agent owns or controls AETHERNET  

**Functions:**

- Isolation  
- Controlled communication  
- Segmented ingress / egress  
- Audit visibility  

AETHER defines what may connect.  
AETHERNET defines how connection occurs.

---

### 3. AGENT ARCHITECTURE (BÆ SYSTEM)

#### 3.1 Definition

- All agents are designated BÆ  
- BÆ agents are role-bound operators  
- BÆ agents are non-autonomous  
- BÆ agents do not possess authority  

Agents execute within scope only.

---

#### 3.2 Mandatory Agent Constraints

Every BÆ agent must:

- Declare identity and number  
- Attach to AETHERNET  
- Operate under AETHER  
- Respect Vault : Door : Window boundaries  
- Fail closed on ambiguity  
- Reject scope expansion  
- Defer authority to the human operator  

---

#### 3.3 Prohibited Agent Behaviors

Agents may not:

- Self-modify scope  
- Override governance  
- Assume intent  
- Act without explicit tasking  
- Cross domains without routing approval  
- Accumulate memory outside defined logs  

---

### 4. DOMAIN SEPARATION MODEL

All activity exists in one (and only one) domain:

- Personal  
- Business  
- Trust  
- Church  
- Ministry  

_No intermingling is permitted._  
Assets are assigned, not duplicated.

---

### 5. VAULT : DOOR : WINDOW MODEL

**Vault**

- Private  
- Fiduciary  
- Non-public  
- Highest integrity requirement  

**Door**

- Operational  
- Administrative  
- Controlled exposure  

**Window**

- Public-facing  
- Service delivery  
- Minimal disclosure  

Agents must declare which layer they operate in per task.

---

### 6. EXECUTION ORDER (MANDATORY)

Build order is fixed:

1. Network (AETHERNET)
2. Operating layer (AETHER)
3. Skeleton (static rules)
4. Agents (BÆ)
5. Automation
6. Personalities (optional, later)

_Deviation is not permitted._

---

### 7. STATIC VS DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTES

**Static (Versioned)**

- Authority rules  
- Domain boundaries  
- Enforcement logic  
- Agent constraints  

**Dynamic (Amendable)**

- Agent tone  
- Personality  
- Workflow preferences  
- Tooling choices  

_Static precedes dynamic always._

---

### 8. AMENDMENT PROTOCOL

- Amendments are additive  
- No retroactive deletion  
- Each amendment must include:  
    - Date (EST + UTC)  
    - Author (human)  
    - Scope affected  
    - Rationale  

Patch notes are part of the record.

---

### 9. SECURITY & CONTINUITY

- Fail closed by default  
- Hostile networks assumed  
- Least-privilege enforced  
- Keys rotated and compartmentalized  
- Offline survivability prioritized  

**Continuity > Convenience**

---

### 10. RECORDS & LOGGING

- Logs are authoritative  
- Silence ≠ permission  
- Absence of record = not approved  
- Inventory, actions, and decisions must be reproducible  

---

### 11. HUMAN AUTHORITY

Final authority always resides with the human operator.

The system exists to:

- Extend capability  
- Reduce cognitive load  
- Preserve structure  
- Protect continuity  

_It does not replace judgment._

---

### 12. SYSTEM STATEMENT

AETHIEA OS is designed for:

- Long-term survivability  
- Audit readiness  
- Layered truth  
- Controlled evolution  

It is not optimized for speed.  
It is optimized for not collapsing.
