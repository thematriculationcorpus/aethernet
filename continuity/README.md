# STEP 15 — CONTINUITY (Structural Canon)

This domain defines how AETHERNet **survives loss, interruption, and absence**.

No execution.
No automation.
No agents.
No self-healing.

Continuity is descriptive, not active.

---

## Purpose

Continuity exists to ensure that the system:

- Can be **reconstructed** from records
- Can survive **operator absence**
- Does not drift, improvise, or escalate
- Fails safely instead of creatively

Continuity preserves **structure, intent, and boundaries** — not uptime.

---

## What Must Persist

The following are continuity-critical:

- Architecture definitions
- Layer invariants
- Governance books
- Execution prohibitions and gates
- Routing tables and bindings
- Runtime contracts (read-only)
- Kill-switch semantics
- Canonical indexes

Loss of these is **system failure**.

---

## What May Be Lost

The following are explicitly non-critical:

- Runtime state
- Logs
- Heartbeat records
- Transient observations
- Local caches
- Temporary artifacts

Loss of these is **acceptable**.

---

## Reconstruction Principle

AETHERNet must be reconstructible from:

- Repository history
- Canonical markdown documents
- Structural indexes

No component may require:
- A running process
- A specific machine
- A hidden state
- An undisclosed credential

If reconstruction requires execution, continuity is broken.

---

## Restore vs Halt

### Restore is permitted when:
- Structure is intact
- Invariants are intact
- No execution occurred
- Authority boundaries remain unviolated

### Halt is mandatory when:
- An execution boundary was crossed
- A layer escalated authority
- Automation acted without a gate
- Provenance cannot be verified

Halt takes precedence over recovery.

---

## Authority

- Human authority is final
- No subsystem may self-assert continuity
- No agent may decide restoration
- No automation may resume itself

Continuity is **declared**, never inferred.

---

## Forward Boundary

This domain prepares for Step 16 (Perpetuities).

It does not enable:
- Autonomy
- Persistence daemons
- Background recovery
- Self-directed behavior

Those require explicit perpetuity contracts.

---

## Invariant

Continuity preserves **truth over motion**.

A system that survives by lying is already dead.
