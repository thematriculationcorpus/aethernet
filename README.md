# AETHERNET

## Purpose
AETHERNET serves as the Source of Truth for all components in the stack. It governs architecture, code, workflows, and documentation to ensure continuity, clarity, and control.

## Build Sequence
1. GitHub → Establish the Source of Truth
2. Local AI → Stabilize reasoning models
3. Edge → Define a minimal public interface
4. Containers → Make everything portable
5. Automation → Add workflows after clarity
6. Server → Execution comes last

## Core Rules
1. Local-first: Everything must run locally first.
2. Versioned-only: If it’s not versioned here, it’s not real.
