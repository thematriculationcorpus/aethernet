AETHERNET
Purpose
AETHERNET serves as the Source of Truth for all components in the stack. It governs architecture, code, workflows, and documentation to ensure continuity, clarity, and control.

Build Sequence
GitHub → Establish the Source of Truth
Local AI → Stabilize reasoning models
Edge → Define a minimal public interface
Containers → Make everything portable
Automation → Add workflows after clarity
Server → Execution comes last
Core Rules
Local-first: Everything must run locally first.
Versioned-only: If it’s not versioned here, it’s not real.
Add, commit, push
git add README.md git commit -m "Add AETHER documentation" git push
