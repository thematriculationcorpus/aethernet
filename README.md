# AETHERNET

AETHERNET is the Source of Truth for the entire stack—governing architecture, code, workflows, and documentation to ensure continuity, clarity, and operator-level control.

---

## Purpose

AETHERNET guarantees that every system element is consistently documented, versioned, and reproducible.

---

## Build Sequence

1. **GitHub** – Source of Truth established  
2. **Local AI** – Reasoning models stabilized  
3. **Edge** – Minimal public interface defined  
4. **Containers** – Component portability enabled  
5. **Automation** – Workflows added post-clarity  
6. **Server** – Execution is always last  

---

## Core Rules

1. **Local-first:** All components must run locally first.  
2. **Versioned-only:** If it’s not versioned here, it’s not real.
