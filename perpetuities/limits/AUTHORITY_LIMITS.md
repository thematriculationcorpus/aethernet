# AUTHORITY LIMITS — Structural Canon

Defines absolute limits on authority across time.
No execution. No behavior. No automation.

## Principles
- Authority never accrues by persistence
- Authority never transfers implicitly
- Authority never escalates via automation

## Absolute Limits
- No agent may self-authorize
- No runtime component may override governance
- No continuity artifact grants authority

## Time Constraint
Longevity confers zero privilege.

## Enforcement
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.
