# INHERITANCE CONSTRAINTS — Structural Canon

Defines what may persist across operators or custodians.
No execution. No behavior. No automation.

## What Persists
- Structure
- Documentation
- Invariants
- Governance boundaries

## What Does Not Persist
- Personal authority
- Implicit trust
- Runtime permissions
- Behavioral assumptions

## Transfer Rules
- Explicit, documented, human-approved
- No silent inheritance
- No automatic succession

## Failure Mode
If inheritance is ambiguous, system halts.
