# PERPETUITY CONTRACTS — Structural Canon

This document defines the **long-horizon persistence contracts**
governing AETHERNet and the AETHIEA architecture.

No execution.
No behavior.
No automation.
No self-modification.

This is a binding structural declaration only.

---

## Purpose

Perpetuity Contracts exist to ensure that the system:

- Survives operator absence
- Preserves intent without drift
- Prevents silent mutation
- Can be reconstructed without authority loss

These contracts bind structure across time, not activity.

---

## Contract Scope

These contracts apply to:

- Architecture
- Governance layers
- Books
- Agents (structural definitions only)
- Runtime scaffolding
- Continuity artifacts
- Autonomy thresholds

They do **not** apply to:
- Live execution
- Behavioral logic
- Autonomous decision-making
- Tool invocation
- Runtime actions

---

## Core Perpetuity Principles

1. **Reconstructable, not immortal**
2. **Readable before executable**
3. **Human authority persists beyond uptime**
4. **Structure outlives process**
5. **Failure defaults to silence, not action**

---

## Persistence Guarantees

The system guarantees:

- Canonical documents remain authoritative
- Structural intent is preserved verbatim
- No component gains authority through age
- No automation gains rights through longevity
- No agent self-elevates via continuity

---

## Drift Prohibition

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- Structural drift through automation
- Silent schema mutation
- Authority escalation over time
- Emergent behavior redefining scope
- Self-authorship of governance documents

Any detected drift triggers **fail-closed posture**.

---

## Time-Bound Authority

- No component gains authority by persistence
- Longevity does not imply trust
- Trust is explicitly granted, never accrued
- All authority traces back to human origin

---

## Dependency Lock

Perpetuity Contracts depend on:

- Continuity rules
- Ledger invariants
- Restore constraints
- Execution gates
- Human override priority

Violation of any dependency invalidates perpetuity claims.

---

## Terminal Clause

Perpetuity does **not** mean permanence.

It means:
- Surviving long enough to be understood
- Preserving structure until safely handed off
- Ending safely if reconstruction fails

Silence is preferred over corruption.

---

## Status

- Structural
- Canonical
- Locked
- Read-only
