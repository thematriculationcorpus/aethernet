# PERPETUITIES — Structural Canon (Step 16)

This document defines **long-horizon persistence rules** for AETHERNet.
It governs what may endure beyond active supervision.

No behavior.
No autonomous decision-making.
No uncapped execution.

---

## Purpose

Perpetuities exist to preserve **continuity, memory, and recoverability**
across time, absence, disruption, or operator unavailability.

Persistence is allowed **only** where it increases survivability
without increasing authority.

---

## What May Persist

The following may persist across time:

- Records, ledgers, and archives
- Structural state snapshots
- Read-only monitoring and signaling
- Heartbeat and liveness indicators
- Recovery and reconstruction metadata

Persistence is descriptive, not directive.

---

## What Must Expire

The following **must not persist** without renewal:

- Execution permissions
- Control authority
- Runtime write access
- Network escalation rights
- Any process capable of self-extension

Expiration is mandatory by default.

---

## Perpetuity Constraints

All perpetuities are bound by:

- Explicit scope
- Explicit limits
- Explicit revocation
- Explicit ownership

No implicit inheritance.
No silent continuation.
No self-renewal.

---

## Revocation Supremacy

Revocation overrides all perpetuities.

Any of the following immediately terminate persistence:

- Kill-switch activation
- Contract violation
- Integrity failure
- Loss of audit visibility
- Human override

Fail-closed is mandatory.

---

## Human Authority

Human authority is absolute and non-delegable.

Perpetuities exist to **serve continuity**, not replace agency.

---

## Forward Boundary

Automation, agents, and autonomous behavior
must route through:

- Execution Gates
- Observation Contracts
- Heartbeat & Liveness
- Kill-Switch & Containment

Absent these, perpetuity is denied.
