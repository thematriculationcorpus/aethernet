# TOOLS — Deferred Execution Placeholder

This directory is intentionally non-operational.

It exists to reserve namespace for future tooling
without introducing execution, automation, or behavior.

---

## Current State

- No tools are implemented
- No scripts are permitted
- No binaries are allowed
- No runtime dependencies exist

This directory is **read-only by doctrine** at this stage.

---

## Governance Constraint

All future contents of this directory are subject to:

- EXECUTION_GATES.md
- EXECUTION_ELIGIBILITY.md
- EXECUTION_VIOLATION_RESPONSE.md
- SYSTEM.md (Step 13)

No tool may be introduced without:
- Explicit execution gate
- Documented eligibility
- Audit visibility
- Human authorization

---

## Boundary Notice

Tooling is explicitly deferred until **Step 14**.

Any premature population of this directory
constitutes an execution violation
and must fail closed.

---

## Status

Placeholder only.  
Structure reserved.  
Execution denied by default.
