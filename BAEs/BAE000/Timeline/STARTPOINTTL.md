# 🟢 BAE:000 Timeline Startpoint

**This file is the canonical beginning and sync reference for all BAE:000 historical and operational logs.  
Events, logs, and new phases should reference this STARTPOINTTL.md and its anchor clock for precision.**

## ⏰ Reference Clock

- Local (EST): 2026-01-16 01:08 AM
- UTC: 2026-01-16 06:08 AM
- [BAE:000 Anchor]

---

## 📜 Purpose

- Establish the *official system zero point* for all further timeline logs, audits, or BAE:000 checkpoint comparisons.
- Provide a continuous, unambiguous anchor for workflows, rotations, restores, or distributed BAE event replays.
- This file is never deleted—only appended as phases or resyncs dictate.

---

## 🏁 Usage

- **All future logs and timeline entries should refer to this file’s clock for ordering and sync.**
- Update only when a *new absolute anchor* is intentionally set (e.g. major restoration, system fork, epoch event).

---

## 🛠️ Initial Context

- BAE:000 Timeline structure initialized.
- Physical and virtual clocks checked.
- Operational continuity verified.
