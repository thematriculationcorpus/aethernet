# Authority & Override Matrix
(Structural · Canonical · Non-Interpretive)

This document defines authority boundaries,
override permissions,
and explicit non-authorities across the system.

Authority means:
- the right to permit or deny execution
- the right to change scope
- the right to override constraints

Override means:
- bypassing a rule
- suspending a restriction
- altering default behavior

---

## Global Principles

- Authority is scarce by design.
- Override is exceptional, not normal.
- No component may self-authorize.
- No component may override itself.
- Silence is not authority.

---

## Layer-Level Authority

### AETHER
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Consolidation without command
- Coherence without control
- Observes authority, does not hold it

---

### AETHERNET
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Transport has no power
- Routing ≠ permission

---

### MONOCLE
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Perception only
- No interpretive authority
- No gating power

---

### AETHIE
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Display without control
- Interface ≠ command surface

---

### VAULT
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Holds doctrine and record
- Does not enforce
- Does not grant permission

---

### DOOR
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Exposure mediation only
- No permission granting
- No exception handling

---

### WINDOW
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Presentation only
- No transactional power
- No backend control

---

### HABITAT
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Notes:
- Execution surface only
- Cannot authorize itself
- Cannot expand scope

---

## Agent-Level Authority

### All BÆ Agents (000–016)
Authority: ❌ NONE  
Override: ❌ NONE

Agents may:
- flag
- warn
- freeze (visibility only)
- describe consequences

Agents may NOT:
- authorize
- override
- enforce
- compel action

Freeze ≠ authority.
Freeze is containment pending human review.

---

## Human Operator

Authority: ✅ SOLE HOLDER  
Override: ✅ SOLE HOLDER

Constraints:
- Must act through HABITAT
- Must respect layer boundaries
- Must accept auditability
- Must accept consequence visibility

The human may:
- authorize execution
- deny execution
- override constraints **explicitly**
- assume responsibility for outcomes

---

## Prohibited Authorities

The following are explicitly denied authority:
- Agents
- Layers
- Automation
- Policies
- Narratives
- Beliefs
- Emergencies
- Time pressure

No condition grants authority by default.

---

## Absolute Invariants

- There is exactly **one authority**.
- Authority does not propagate.
- Authority does not delegate.
- Override does not persist unless reasserted.
- No hidden authority exists.

Any claim of implicit authority
is a **system violation**.

Authority is explicit or it does not exist.
