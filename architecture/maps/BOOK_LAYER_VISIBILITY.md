# Book ↔ Layer Visibility Map
(Structure-Only · Read-Only)

This document defines which architectural layers are
*observable* by each Book of Knowledge.

Visibility does NOT imply:
- authority
- influence
- execution
- interpretation
- permission

This is a read-only epistemic map.

## BOOK OF AVOIDANCE

### Visible Layers
- AETHERNET (signal presence only)
- MONOCLE (existence of signal, not content)
- WINDOW (public exposure state)

### Explicitly NOT Visible
- VAULT
- DOOR (internal logic)
- HABITAT
- AETHIE
- AETHER

### Rationale
Avoidance operates pre-engagement.
It requires awareness of *whether contact exists*, not *what it contains*.

---

## BOOK OF COMPLIANCE

### Visible Layers
- DOOR (structural interfaces)
- WINDOW (public representations)
- HABITAT (execution boundaries only)
- AETHERNET (transport paths, not payloads)

### Explicitly NOT Visible
- VAULT
- MONOCLE
- AETHIE
- AETHER

### Rationale
Compliance governs lawful and procedural exposure.
It observes structure, not intent, meaning, or alignment.

---

## BOOK OF ACCORDANCE

### Visible Layers
- MONOCLE (alignment framing only)
- AETHIE (rendered summaries)
- AETHER (coherence references)

### Explicitly NOT Visible
- HABITAT
- DOOR
- WINDOW
- AETHERNET
- VAULT (contents)

### Rationale
Accordance evaluates alignment between stated values,
behavioral posture, and consequence—without execution.

---

## Global Constraints

- No Book may see VAULT contents.
- No Book may observe execution in HABITAT.
- No Book may issue directives to any layer.
- Visibility does not persist beyond its declared scope.

Violation of visibility boundaries triggers fail-closed posture.

This document defines *what may be seen*, nothing more.
