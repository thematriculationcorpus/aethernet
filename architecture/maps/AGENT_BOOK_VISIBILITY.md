# Agent ↔ Book Visibility Map
(Structure-Only · Read-Only)

This document defines which BÆ agents may observe
which Books of Knowledge.

Visibility does NOT imply:
- authority
- execution
- influence
- interpretation
- escalation

This is a read-only epistemic boundary map.

## BOOK OF AVOIDANCE

### Visible To
- BÆ:005 — Compliance & Continuity Enforcement (flag-only)
- BÆ:008 — Anomaly Detection (pre-contact deviation sensing)
- BÆ:015 — Temporal & Cultural Intelligence (timing, silence, delay)

### Explicitly NOT Visible To
- BÆ:003 (Fiduciary)
- BÆ:004 (Security / Build)
- BÆ:009 / BÆ:014 (Adversarial)
- BÆ:012 (Interpretive / Myth)
- BÆ:013 (Containment)
- All execution-capable contexts

### Rationale
Avoidance is upstream of engagement.
Only agents concerned with *whether to engage at all* may see it.

## BOOK OF COMPLIANCE

### Visible To
- BÆ:005 — Compliance & Continuity Enforcement
- BÆ:003 — Fiduciary Governance Intelligence
- BÆ:004 — Defensive Systems Discipline
- BÆ:000 — Archivist / Time Auditor (record only)

### Explicitly NOT Visible To
- BÆ:012 (Interpretive / Myth)
- BÆ:013 (Containment)
- BÆ:016 (Street Logic)
- BÆ:010 (Dual Perspective)
- BÆ:002 (Diagnostics beyond boundary state)

### Rationale
Compliance governs admissibility, structure, and survivability.
Only governance-aligned agents may observe it.

---

## BOOK OF ACCORDANCE

### Visible To
- BÆ:006 — Ecclesiastical / Accordance Intelligence
- BÆ:012 — Interpretive Metaphysics & Myth (non-executive)
- BÆ:010 — Monocle Stewards (perspective calibration)
- BÆ:000 — Archivist (continuity record only)

### Explicitly NOT Visible To
- BÆ:005 (enforcement)
- BÆ:004 (security/build)
- BÆ:016 (street logic)
- BÆ:008 (anomaly detection)
- Any execution or enforcement context

### Rationale
Accordance evaluates alignment, not control.
It must never be co-mingled with power or enforcement.

---

## Global Constraints

- No agent may see a Book outside its declared scope.
- No agent may act on Book visibility.
- No Book may be queried by execution layers.
- Visibility does not persist beyond session context.

Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

This document defines *who may observe which doctrine*.
Nothing more.
