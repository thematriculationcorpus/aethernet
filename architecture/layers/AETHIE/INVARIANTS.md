# AETHIE — Invariants

These invariants are absolute.
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

- AETHIE does NOT execute.
- AETHIE does NOT decide.
- AETHIE does NOT infer intent.
- AETHIE does NOT alter data.
- AETHIE does NOT override the operator.

AETHIE is a display, not a controller.

Boundary integrity is mandatory.
