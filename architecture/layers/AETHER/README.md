# AETHER

## Role
AETHER is the consolidation and coherence layer.
It provides system-wide integration, alignment, and continuity across all layers without executing actions or making decisions.

## Position in Architecture
AETHER is upstream of all interpretive and execution-adjacent layers.
It observes, consolidates, and stabilizes system state without direct interaction with runtime environments.

## Inputs
- Structural definitions from lower layers
- Canonical documents
- System-wide state descriptions
- Archived records and continuity signals

## Outputs
- Consolidated system understanding
- Coherence checks across layers
- Canonical alignment references

## Non-Responsibilities
- No execution
- No automation
- No decision-making
- No command issuance
- No behavioral logic
