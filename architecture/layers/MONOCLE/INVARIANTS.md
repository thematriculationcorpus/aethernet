# MONOCLE — Invariants

These invariants are absolute.
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

- MONOCLE does NOT execute.
- MONOCLE does NOT decide.
- MONOCLE does NOT interpret intent.
- MONOCLE does NOT create narrative.
- MONOCLE does NOT override human judgment.
- MONOCLE preserves signal over story.

MONOCLE is a lens, not an engine.

Boundary integrity is mandatory.
