# MONOCLE

## Role
MONOCLE is the perception and reality-alignment layer.
It frames, filters, and clarifies incoming information without interpretation, judgment, or execution.

## Position in Architecture
MONOCLE sits upstream of agents and downstream of raw signal transport.
It precedes reasoning, narrative, and action.

## Inputs
- Signals delivered via AETHERNET
- Observations from layers and agents
- Environmental and contextual data

## Outputs
- Clarified signal
- Noise-reduced perception
- Framed inputs suitable for downstream reasoning

## Non-Responsibilities
- No interpretation
- No conclusions
- No decisions
- No execution
- No narrative construction
- No authority claims
