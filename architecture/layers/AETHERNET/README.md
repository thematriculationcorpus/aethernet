# AETHERNET

## Role
AETHERNET is the connective transport layer.
It enables communication, signaling, and data movement between layers and agents without interpretation, authority, or execution.

## Position in Architecture
AETHERNET sits between AETHER and all downstream layers.
It carries information but does not alter, judge, or prioritize it.

## Inputs
- Messages from layers and agents
- State signals
- Structured data packets
- Requests routed by higher layers

## Outputs
- Delivered messages
- Routed signals
- Transported data between authorized endpoints

## Non-Responsibilities
- No interpretation
- No decision-making
- No execution
- No prioritization
- No modification of content
- No authority over endpoints
