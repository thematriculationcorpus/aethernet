# STEP 12 — PACKAGE (LOCKED)

## Status
**LOCKED · STRUCTURE-ONLY**

## Scope
This step finalizes **structural artifacts only**.  
No behavior, execution, automation, or dynamics are introduced here.

## Included Artifacts
- Architecture layers (VAULT, DOOR, WINDOW, HABITAT, MONOCLE, AETHIE, AETHERNET, AETHER)
- Books of Knowledge (AVOIDANCE, COMPLIANCE, ACCORDANCE)
- Cross-layer maps (read-only)
- Governance routing tables
- Execution governance (gates, eligibility, audit, violation response)
- Structural bindings and indices

## Explicit Exclusions
- No runtime logic
- No behavioral definitions
- No automation
- No agent personality, tone, or dynamics
- No scope expansion

## Invariants
- Package contents are immutable unless this lock is explicitly lifted
- All documents are descriptive and non-executive
- Any violation triggers fail-closed posture

## Transition Rule
Advancement beyond this point constitutes entry into **Step 13 — System**  
and requires an explicit, intentional unlock.

**End of Step 12.**
