# Agent Visibility Table (Read-Only)

Agents observe. Agents do not decide.

## General Rules

- All agents are non-executive
- Visibility ≠ permission
- Observation does not imply memory persistence

## Constraints

- Vault-bound agents may not observe WINDOW
- Compliance agents may not observe ACCORDANCE
- No agent may observe across Vault ↔ Window boundary
