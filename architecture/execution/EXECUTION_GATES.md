# EXECUTION GATES — STRUCTURAL CANON

This document defines absolute execution boundaries within AETHIEA.

Execution is not assumed.
Execution is not emergent.
Execution is always explicitly gated.

This file defines where execution is **never permitted** and where it **must stop**.

No behavior.
No automation.
No implementation detail.

---

## Definition

**Execution** means any action that:
- changes state
- produces side effects
- writes to systems, networks, or environments
- initiates processes beyond observation or description

Anything not explicitly allowed is denied.

---

## Global Rule

Execution is **opt-in only**.
Default posture is **deny**.

Violation of any gate triggers **fail-closed**.

---

## Absolute No-Execution Layers

Execution is **never permitted** in the following layers:

- AETHER
- AETHERNET
- MONOCLE
- AETHIE
- VAULT

These layers are:
- descriptive
- observational
- interpretive
- archival

They may not:
- act
- write
- command
- automate
- escalate authority

---

## Conditional Boundary Layers

### DOOR
- May relay execution intent
- May not execute itself
- Cannot override upstream constraints

### WINDOW
- May surface execution results
- May not initiate execution
- Write-back is prohibited

---

## Habitat Constraint

**HABITAT** is the only layer where execution may occur.

Execution in HABITAT is:
- external to this architecture
- human-initiated
- reversible where possible
- bounded by prior gates

No upstream layer may compel HABITAT to act.

---

## Cross-Layer Enforcement

- No layer may grant execution rights to another layer
- No lateral execution is permitted
- No execution may cross Vault / Door / Window boundaries

Authority does not propagate.
Execution does not inherit.

---

## Failure Posture

Any violation of an execution gate results in:

- immediate denial
- no partial execution
- no degradation mode
- no fallback behavior

System posture: **fail-closed**

---

## Canonical Status

This document is:
- structural
- non-negotiable
- scope-locking

Execution policy is defined elsewhere.
This file defines **where execution ends**.
