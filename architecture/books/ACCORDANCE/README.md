# BOOK OF ACCORDANCE

## Role
The Book of Accordance defines internal alignment.
It governs coherence between stated values, internal doctrine, lived behavior, and consequence.

Accordance does not enforce.
It reflects.

## Position in Architecture
Accordance operates internal to the system.
It is parallel to Compliance and downstream of Avoidance.
It never interfaces directly with execution layers.

## Inputs
- Internal doctrine
- Declared principles
- Observed actions
- Recorded outcomes
- Continuity records

## Outputs
- Alignment assessments
- Misalignment visibility
- Doctrinal coherence checks
- Internal truth statements

## Non-Responsibilities
- No execution
- No enforcement
- No persuasion
- No punishment
- No compliance substitution
- No authority claims

Accordance exists to tell the truth about alignment,
not to make alignment happen.
