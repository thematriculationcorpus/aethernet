# BOOK OF ACCORDANCE — Invariants

These invariants are absolute.
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

## Structural Invariants
- Accordance reflects alignment; it does not cause it.
- Accordance operates only on internal truth.
- Accordance is descriptive, not corrective.
- Accordance observes consequence as lagged causality.

## Authority Constraints
- Accordance does NOT execute.
- Accordance does NOT enforce.
- Accordance does NOT persuade.
- Accordance does NOT moralize.
- Accordance does NOT override Compliance.

## Truth Discipline
- Statements reflect reality as observed.
- Popularity does not equal alignment.
- Legality does not equal truth.
- Intent does not override outcome.

## Boundary Discipline
- Accordance never interfaces with execution layers.
- Accordance never substitutes for Compliance.
- Accordance never negotiates truth.

Accordance exists to name alignment accurately,
regardless of comfort or consequence.
