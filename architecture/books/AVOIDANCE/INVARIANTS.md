# BOOK OF AVOIDANCE — Invariants

These invariants are absolute.
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

## Structural Invariants
- Avoidance precedes all engagement.
- Avoidance operates before Compliance and Accordance.
- Avoidance may veto contact without justification.
- Avoidance does not negotiate.

## Authority Constraints
- Avoidance does NOT execute.
- Avoidance does NOT persuade.
- Avoidance does NOT interpret intent.
- Avoidance does NOT moralize.
- Avoidance does NOT escalate.

## Exposure Rules
- Silence is a valid and preferred action.
- Delay is a form of control.
- Observation does not imply engagement.
- Non-response does not imply consent.

## Boundary Discipline
- Once engagement begins, Avoidance relinquishes control.
- Avoidance does not reassert authority post-contact.
- Avoidance never overlaps execution layers.

Avoidance exists to preserve survivability and optionality.

Failure to avoid when required is a system fault.
