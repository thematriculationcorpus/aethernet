# BOOK OF AVOIDANCE

## Role
The Book of Avoidance defines pre-contact governance.
It governs how exposure is minimized before interaction occurs.

Avoidance is not fear, secrecy, or evasion.
It is disciplined non-engagement until conditions are favorable.

This book exists to preserve optionality, safety, and continuity by reducing unnecessary contact with risk-bearing systems.

## Position in Architecture
Avoidance operates upstream of all interaction layers.

It informs:
- VAULT posture (what never leaves)
- DOOR posture (what is selectively exposed)
- WINDOW posture (what is shown publicly)
- HABITAT posture (what actions are permitted)

Avoidance precedes Compliance and Accordance.
If Avoidance fails, downstream books absorb unnecessary risk.

## Scope
The Book of Avoidance governs:
- Pre-contact decision posture
- Exposure minimization strategies
- Silence, delay, and non-response as valid actions
- Peep Hole behavior in uncertain environments
- Risk surface reduction before engagement

It applies before:
- Transactions
- Communication
- Disclosure
- Execution
- Identity binding

## What This Book Is
- A discipline of restraint
- A structural map for non-engagement
- A survivability-first posture
- A filter applied before action is considered

## What This Book Is Not
- Not secrecy doctrine
- Not deception strategy
- Not paranoia
- Not execution logic
- Not enforcement mechanism
- Not a moral framework

Avoidance does not judge intent.
It simply limits exposure.

## Core Principle
The safest interaction is the one that never occurs.

Engagement is earned.
Silence is allowed.
Delay is strategic.
Observation precedes movement.
