# BOOK OF COMPLIANCE

## Role
The Book of Compliance governs interaction with external systems, laws, institutions, and enforcement realities.
It defines how the system survives contact with the outside world without surrendering internal truth or authority.

## Position in Architecture
Compliance operates after Avoidance and alongside Accordance.
It is activated only when engagement is unavoidable or chosen.

## Scope
- Statutory interaction
- Regulatory adherence
- Defensive legality
- Interface survivability

Compliance does not define truth.
Compliance defines exposure tolerance.

## Inputs
- External requirements
- Legal or regulatory constraints
- Institutional demands
- Enforcement risk signals

## Outputs
- Minimum-viable conformity
- Documented adherence
- Defensive alignment artifacts
- Exposure-limited interaction

## Non-Responsibilities
- No moral judgment
- No belief enforcement
- No truth arbitration
- No internal governance
- No mission definition
