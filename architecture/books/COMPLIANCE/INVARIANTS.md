# BOOK OF COMPLIANCE — Invariants

These invariants are absolute.
Violation triggers fail-closed posture.

## Structural Invariants
- Compliance is reactive, not initiatory.
- Compliance activates only after Avoidance fails or is bypassed.
- Compliance operates parallel to Accordance, never above it.
- Compliance is context-bound and revocable.

## Authority Constraints
- Compliance does NOT define truth.
- Compliance does NOT override internal doctrine.
- Compliance does NOT execute actions.
- Compliance does NOT grant legitimacy.

## Exposure Rules
- Only minimum viable compliance is permitted.
- Over-disclosure is a fault.
- Silence beyond requirement is preferred.
- Documentation exists to satisfy enforcement, not belief.

## Boundary Discipline
- Compliance never enters the VAULT.
- Compliance never rewrites Accordance.
- Compliance never authorizes execution layers.

Compliance exists to survive enforcement, not to seek approval.

Failure to comply when required is a system risk.
Over-compliance is a system leak.
