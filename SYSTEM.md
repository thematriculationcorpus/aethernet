# STEP 13 — SYSTEM

## System Identity
AETHERNet is a non-executive, governance-first operating architecture
composed of layered structure, constrained knowledge domains,
and deny-by-default execution controls.

## System Composition
- Layers define positional constraints
- Books define governance domains
- Maps define visibility and flow
- Execution documents define prohibition and gating

## Global Invariants
- No execution without explicit gate
- No authority escalation
- No layer boundary violation
- Human authority is final

## System Posture
- Read-first
- Observe-only
- Fail-closed by default

## Locked Dependencies
This system depends on:
- PACKAGE.md (Step 12)
- Architecture index
- Execution governance
- Routing tables

## Forward Boundary
Automation, runtime, and behavior are explicitly deferred to Step 14.
