# AETHIEA Lifecycle — Sealed (0–16)

This document asserts completion of the structural lifecycle:

0–16 are defined, scaffolded, and bound.
No behavior is authorized.
No automation is active.

Amendments require:
- Explicit versioning
- Human authority
- Audit trail

This system is complete by design.
