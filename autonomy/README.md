# Autonomy — Latent State (Structural Only)

Autonomy within AETHERNet is **defined but inactive**.

All autonomy artifacts in this directory describe:
- thresholds
- override priority
- degraded modes

They do NOT:
- execute
- schedule
- actuate
- self-initiate

Autonomy remains **latent** until:
- execution gates are explicitly opened
- human authority affirms activation
- continuity safeguards are verified

Default posture: **deny-by-default, fail-closed**.
