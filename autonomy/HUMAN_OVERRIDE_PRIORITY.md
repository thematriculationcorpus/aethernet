# HUMAN OVERRIDE PRIORITY — Structural Canon

This document defines the absolute priority of human authority
over any autonomous, conditional, or degraded system state.

No execution.
No automation.
No behavioral logic.

---

## Authority Ordering (Highest → Lowest)

1. Human Operator (explicit intent)
2. Kill-Switch / Containment Controls
3. Execution Gates
4. Autonomy Thresholds
5. Runtime Continuity Functions

No layer, agent, or subsystem may supersede this order.

---

## Override Conditions

Human override applies when:
- Explicit command is issued
- Emergency intervention is required
- Ambiguity exists in system state
- Conflicting directives are detected

---

## Override Effects

Upon override:
- All autonomous activity halts
- System enters fail-closed posture
- State is preserved for audit
- No rollback occurs unless human-authorized

---

## Non-Delegation Rule

Human override authority:
- Cannot be delegated
- Cannot be inferred
- Cannot be time-delayed
- Cannot be disabled by automation

---

## Failure Rule

If override channel is unavailable or unclear,
the system defaults to **AUTONOMY DISABLED**.
