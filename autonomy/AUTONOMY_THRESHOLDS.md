# AUTONOMY THRESHOLDS — Structural Canon

This document defines the conditions under which
autonomy MAY be permitted, constrained, degraded, or denied.

No execution.
No automation.
No behavioral logic.

## Autonomy States

The system recognizes four autonomy states:

1. **DISABLED**
   - No autonomous continuation permitted
   - Observation-only allowed

2. **LIMITED**
   - Only non-destructive continuity functions allowed
   - No external interaction
   - No state mutation

3. **DEGRADED**
   - Survival-only operations permitted
   - Reduced scope
   - Mandatory audit trail

4. **CONDITIONAL**
   - Autonomy permitted only within predefined bounds
   - Human override always supersedes

---

## Promotion Rules

Autonomy state may ONLY be elevated when:
- Execution gates explicitly allow it
- Human override channel is reachable
- Kill-switch is armed and responsive
- Audit visibility is intact

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

Autonomy is NEVER permitted to:
- Escalate authority
- Modify governance documents
- Disable containment mechanisms
- Override human intent

---

## Fail-Closed Rule

If autonomy state is ambiguous,
the system defaults to **DISABLED**.
